# Welcome!

This webpage features documentation about PSRCore, a software developed by PSR.

### So, what is PSRCore?

From a user perspective, PSR Core is a web system designed for storing and managing data related to energy production, distribution and other related activities. It can easily be accessed through any web browser, such as Google Chrome (recommended), without the need to install additional software on their local machines. 

From a software developer perspective, PSRCore is a framework that connects a database (local or distributed) to a web interface that can be accessed from anywhere. It is mainly used for hosting applications related to energy distribution and simulation, but it can serve to other purposes.

### Main features

Some key features include the ability to run simulations directly from the web, import and export local excel files, and monitor those changes across multiple devices. More on those features is discussed along the documentation.
