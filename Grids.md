## Grids

An example grid is shown in the picture below. The numbers in the image are associated to common functionalities that are widely used to manage the data inside the grid.

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

### 1. Add
Adds a single line to the table.

### 2. Save
Save any changes made to the table. The interface will ask if the user wants to save before leaving the page, in case there are any unsaved changes.

### 3. Export
Allows the user to save the data to a local csv file.

### 4. Import
Allows the user to load data from a local csv file into the system.

### 5. Atributes
Name of the attribute for the corresponding column. When clicked, it's possible to reorder lines in decreasing or increasing order, depending on the attribute specified. Most grids contain an "Identification" attribute, which must be unique for every entry.

### 6. Atribute options

### 7. Grid fields
Fields that hold the table data. May have diverse types (number, text, a dropdown list). Some data visualization options can be configured in the user configurations.

Data is marked when modified, as shown in the figure, to remember the user to save their changes. The mark is removed once the data is saved.

### 9. Trash bin
Removes the corresponding entry from the grid.

### 10. Pagination
By default, 10 items are shown per page. This can be altered in user confiurations. When there are more to exhibit than what fits the grid, the arrows on the bottom left are automatically enabled to allow navigation between multiple pages of a grid.

### 11. Update
Reloads the grid contents, similar to reloading the page on your web browser.
